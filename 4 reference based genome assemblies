Make sure all the packages are installed (conda install fastqc, conda install cutadapt, conda install bowtie2)
Download the assembly for Carboyxdothermus hydrogenoformas Z2901 from NCBI using the e-utilities accession number CP000141.1
Install e-utilities with conda (conda install entrez-direct)
Download the raw sequencing reads for Carboxydothermus ferrireducens from the google drive 
gdown.pl https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PWWO5wVRRThLBXXEZjyWZHIb9udVcnCS/edit C.ferri_R1.fastq
gdown.pl https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mZFvpSIctuBihkOlQX9vhrkxng3cRmvK/edit C_ferri_R2.fastq
Ran a fast qc for both files (script recorded below)
fastqc C.ferri_R1.fastq
fastqc C_ferri_R2.fastq
After these fastqc files were downloaded I looked at the file data and graphs for this to answer the questions. (This had to be down by first finding the files in WinSCP)
Then came the step of running cutadapt 
cutadapt -q 20,20 -a CTGTCTCTTATACACATCTCCGAGCCCACGAGAC -A CTGTCTCTTATACACATCTGACGCTGCCGACGA -m 50 --max-n 0 -o C.ferri_R1.fastq.cutadapt.fastq -p C_ferri_R2.cutadapt.fastq C.ferri_R1.fastq C_ferri_R2.fastq 
Next was running bowtie2 to index the reference genome to make it possible to search it 
bowtie2-build C.hydrogenoformans_Z2901.fasta C.hydro 
Next bowtie2 was used to map the reads against the indexed reference genome 
bowtie2 -x C.hydro -1 C.hydro_6008_R1.fastq -2 C.hydro_6008_R2.fastq -S 6008.sam
It spit out an error of while flushing and closing output.

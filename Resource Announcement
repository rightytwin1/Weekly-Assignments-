gdown.pl https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_oc15QMOaXGaT0hTxxS2tF477U9ezHcd CTS7_R2.fastq.gz
     These two gdown commands download data off of Google Drive and saves it into the trimming directory as CST7_R1.fastq.gz and CST7_R2.fastq.gz
fastqc CST7_R1.fastq.gz
fastqc CST7_R2.fastq.gz 
     These two fastqc commands provide quality control for the downloaded sequences 
  fastqc for quality assessment 
cutadapt -q 20,20 -a CTGTCTCTTATACACATCTCCGAGCCCACGAGAC -A CTGTCTCTTATACACATCTGACGCTGCCGACGA -m 50 --max-n 0 -o CST7_R1.cutadapt.fastq -p CST7_R2.cutadapt.fastq CST7_R1.fastq.gz CST7_R2.fastq.gz
  This provides quality trimming for the two sequences. 
conda activate de_novo 
   This activates de_novo sequencing
spades.py -k 21,51,71,91,111,127 --careful --pe1-1 CST7_R1.cutadapt.fastq --pe1-2 CST7_R2.cutadapt.fastq -o CST7_spades_output
  This performes de novo (spades is a type under this) on the CST7 data. 
quast contigs.fasta -o Quast_contigs 
   This performs a quality assessment of the assemblied data 
The entirety of this data has been analyzed through WinSCP
